        To start any business one need resources (financial resources, energy
        resources, human resources), Infrastructure, Transportation, Buyers and
        above all secure and safe place. Let’s know a little about UAE – Despite
        its strategic location, the UAE back in 1971 was almost isolated from
        the rest of the world. With its shoreline stretching hundreds of miles,
        it had very primitive ports and virtually no roads connecting it to the
        neighboring countries. Just a few decades ago, going to or leaving the
        UAE was one of the most difficult things for any traveler. They had a
        dusty runway for the whole country that handled an average of one flight
        per week. But now they have the most modern and busiest airports in the
        world and seaports and ports facilities so huge and modern it almost won
        the contract for handling the operations of one of the busiest American
        ports. The most unique thing about the UAE is that it transformed itself
        from the most isolated country in the world to one of the most developed
        countries in the world. Hundreds of events are held every week and
        Formula One is held once a year. The UAE has become a melting pot of
        different cultures. Mind you, majority of the people are not Emiratis.
        And just on 2nd Dec 2019, the United Arab Emirates celebrated its 48th
        National Day. Being founded only four decades ago, it is one of the
        youngest countries in the world. More Options in UAE - Choose emirate
